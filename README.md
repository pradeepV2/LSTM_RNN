# LSTM_RNN
This model is a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory - Recurrent NN Model

# Receipt Matching Challenge
Select most likely transactions related to Receipts

# Problem Identification
Identifying matching and non-matching transactions is a classification problem

# Pre - requisites
1. Python3
2. Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda Naviator)
3. Numpy, Pandas
4. Keras using Tensorflow or theano as backend

Alternately we can use colab if we are facing ENV issues

# Model Expectations
1. Classifying the transactions based on matched and Unmatched transactions
2. Learning the new matching features   

# Approach
1. Consider LSTM model as this is a transactional data (Changes wrt TIME) 
2. Adding Embedded layers for learning new matching features  

# Model Building
Building the LSTM - RNN model using Keras

# SAVE the model

# Predictions
Using the model for making predictions on the complete dataset
